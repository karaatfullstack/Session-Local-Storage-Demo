# Getting Started 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`
  - Project will open on localhost:3000
3. Right click (in Chrome/Firefox) and open the inspect/ dev tools
4. Click the "Application" tab 
  - View the "local storage" and "session storage" sections
5. Now try clicking the "set local" and "set session" buttons - this updates those sections
  - The "get" buttons will display the current number from storage
6. Read the notes in App.js and start practicing!
